	 * data adapter is done with the goal of return two values, a name and an age. An easy option would be expect a field with the name 
	 * "Name" and one with name "Age". But we can do something more flexible, in this case we will enumerate all the fields requested and 
	 * and the first two will be assumed to be for name and age, for all the others will be returned an empty string. So we can have a report 
	 * with more than two fields, but the name and the age will be returned each time only for the first two. 
	 * 
	 * If this example is too much complex refer to the method getFieldValue2, where is shown the first explained, and simple solution, where we 
	 * expect two fields with a precise name.
